# Car_Mileage_Prediction
Predicting the mileage of car using the linear regression model with Scikit-learn

A real data set is trained using the linear regression model with Scitkit-learn

Data set can be downloaded here from Kaggle: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/uciml/autompg-dataset

More datasets can be found here: https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/9/auto+mpg

Libraries used:  pandas, sklearn (Scikit-learn), numpy  (all these libraries are built-in when using Jupyter notebook)

Outcomes:

Extracting dataset with pandas

Analyse and visualize the dataset

Build model using linear regression 

Predict the mileage using the trained model
